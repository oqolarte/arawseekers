Last 10 Jul, we visited Isya's relative who passed in Loyola Makati.
In hindsight, 
it's not usual for a couple to go on a date to someone's funeral,
but we live in a modern world.

Unfortunately, this was also when Ohio misplaced Isya's umbrella,
likely left behind in one of the chapels or sitting benches.

Ohio took the picture above,
because he wanted to note the angle of backrest of the bench,
which felt ergonomic and natural,
unlike the squared ones that didn't quite fit a human spine.

The angle is 15 degrees from the vertical axis.
