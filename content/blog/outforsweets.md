*The idea behind a zero waste store is that you, the buyer, will bring clean, empty jars and containers to be (re)filled.*

Finally, we decided to buy some groceries after learning about Back to Basics shop at Maginhawa St., Diliman, Quezon City. I first learned about BtB from my Nanay, who wanted to visit this Zero Waste store during her stay here in Manila few weeks back. One time, Ohio and I went for a night bike ride. I chanced upon the ecostore when we cruised along Maginhawa St (near Philcoa side). After that we vowed to visit and get whatever supplies we need. 

### Grocery List: 
1. Muscovado Sugar
2. Turmeric
3. White pepper
4. Dishwashing Liquid
5. Handwash Soap
6. Cooking oil (lauric)

On Rizal's birthday today, we biked our way to Maginahwa.

We brought our own jars and plastic dispensing pumps. 

It was a pleasant experience. The store was well lit and smelled nice. Everything was in place.

### Buying steps:

1. They weigh your containers and make note of it.  
2. After weighing, choose from the selection and (re)fill your own containers. Store attendants would also gladly help you with this. 
3. They will weigh again your purchase and deduct the orginal weight of your container. This net weight will be multiplied to whatever is the price per unit weight of the item. 

**EASY PEASY!!!**

We will document how fast we consume the things we bought, and compare it with the expenses we usually have at grocery store. 

We encourage everyone to visit[^1] Back to Basics and other Zero Waste stores near you. Let's do away with sachet culture and single-use plastics. 

Don't forget to bring your grocery list, your own containers, tela bag, bayong, paper bags and a friendly smile. `-o)-  i&o`

[^1]: When you do, please consider walking or biking to the place if you're nearby and/or are able to.
