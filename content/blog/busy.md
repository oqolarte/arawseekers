It's been a long while.

In paper, we're still in lockdown (various versions of "community lockdown") a little over a year now.
That's why we share little here;
our shared experiences have been limited to indoors.
And most of them are nothing to write home about.

A lot has happened since January of this year---and still is happening---in each of our lives, and perhaps will post about some of them here soon...?

For now, though, we each have our own blogs that we look into more than this one.

[Isya's blog](https://leap-isya.netlify.app) is about her trading.  
[Ohio's blog](https://ohio.araw.xyz) is about his current interests.
